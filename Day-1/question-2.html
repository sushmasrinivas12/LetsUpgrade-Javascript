  <h2>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET, VAR AND CONST</h2>
  <p>
    <b> let:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by
    curly braces i.e. {}.<br>
    “let” and “const” are“block scoped”
    <script>
      {
        let a = 10;
        console.log(a);
      }
      //block 1
      {
        a++;
        console.log(a);
      }
      //block 2
      /* Since we are using "let a=10", scope of "a" is limited to block 1 and "a" is not recognized in block 2 */

    </script>
  <p>
    <b>var:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is
    defined.<br>If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
    var is “function scoped”.
  </p>
  <script>
    {
      var b = 10;
      console.log(b);
    } //block 1
    {
      b++;
      console.log(b);
    }
    //block 2
    /* Since we are using "var a=10", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. In this case it is within the global function scope */

  </script>
  <p>
    <b>const: </b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly
    braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.<br>
    “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it <b>CAN</b> be mutated.
  </p>
  <script>
    {
      const pi = 3.14;
      console.log(pi);
    } //block 1
    {
      console.log(pi);
    }
    //block 2
    /* Since we are using "const PI=3.14", scope of "PI" is limited to block 1 and "PI" is not recognized in block 2 */
  </script>
